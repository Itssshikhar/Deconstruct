Immediate Action Items
Week 1-2:
	Extract activations and set up the sparse autoencoder pipeline.
	Train initial SAEs on one layer of GPT-2 using a simple dataset like SST-2.
Week 3-4:
	Conduct probing and clustering experiments.
	Test for interpretability against known benchmarks.
Week 5-6:
	Summarize results, highlighting specific cases where sparse features offer unique insights.
	Optionally prepare a demo or visualization tool for presenting findings.
